## Bryan and Preston's Excellent Coding Competition

_Join Bryan Lim and Preston Lee, who are a former captain and lead programmer of the Issaquah Robotics Society respectively (which is not affiliated with this competition in anyway) for a fun afternoon of coding._

### What Is This?

This competition was inspired by the PSCSTA and Teamscode. Teams will work to solve questions of varying difficulty within a designated time-frame, but there's a twist: that's just the first part. Students will also be judged on solving a single, complex question in the most efficient way possible.

### When and Where?

- Location: Issaquah Arena Sports (Address: 2115 NW Poplar Way)
- Date and Time: Sunday, December 17th from 10AM-3PM.

### Competition Details

Teams of 1-3 students will be select either beginner (less than year of programming experience) or advanced divisions in registration.

Upon arriving, teams will be given time to set-up and read an input text file and give an output using the coding language of their choice.

Teams will be given 2 hours and 45 minutes for round 1. Both beginner and advanced divisions will be given the same 10 questions of easy to moderate difficulty. Each of these questions will be worth 50 points. The advanced division will have access to 5 additional, difficult questions. Each of these questions will be worth 75 points.

Upon completing questions, teams will be given an input file from a judge, who will verify the output from the particpant's terminal. If the output is correct, they will be awarded points, if not, they will still be able to gain points later if their output is correct then, but 5 points will be reduced from each incorrect submission.

Teams will be given 45 minutes for round 2, where they will be given 45 minutes to create the most efficient solution to a single, shared problem. Judges will then determine which is the most efficient and an additional 175 points will be given to the team with the most efficient solution, with 2nd place 250 points, 3rd place 225 points, and so on.

### What You Get

- If you're part of an FRC team, get your programming skills warmed up before build season starts.
- Lunch, drinks, and snacks will be provided.
- If you're one of the top three finishers in either the beginner or advanced divisions, walk home with a custom-made trophy.
- Enter a raffle to win prizes from gift cards to electronics
- The satisfaction of being with Bryan and Preston and the educational value of this excellent event

### Requirements

- One laptop per team (with no exception)
- A $10 entry fee (Covers food and venue. Exceeds will go to funding STEM organizations and clubs around Issaquah. Need-based exceptions can be made.) **Payments can be made at the door**
